# MiniGrep

## Key Points

`minigrep` project combine a number of concepts:

* Organizing code
* Using vectors and strings
* Handling errors
* Using traits and lifetimes where appropriate
* Writing tests

## Test-Driven Development

1. Write a test that fails and run it to make sure it fails for the reason you expect
2. Write or modify just enough code to make the new test pass
3. Refactor the code you just added or changed and make sure the tests continue to pass
4. Repeat from step 1
